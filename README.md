# Factors Influencing Housing Prices
## Statistics for Data Science

### Introduction
Selling a house is not likely a familiar process or a common occurrence for many people.  However when it does happen, when is the best time to sell?  What factors may have an influence for sellers to get top dollar for the homes they are selling?  Home ownership is probably one of the biggest investments for many people, so it is important to maximize the price if an owner does decide to sell.
Data sets from Redfin will be analyzed to determine relationships with regard to the price of homes.  Variables such as median sale price, number of homes sold, inventory, number of new listings and others will be investigated.  Calculations, plots and correlation data for these variables will be completed.
